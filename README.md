## Hi, I'm Deepak Jangir

<p><samp>
  I'm a passionate and keenly interested starter in the software world.<br/><br/>
  I recently worked at <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/support/service-center/">Samsung India</a> as a Service Engineer. I also maintain several Android custom ROMs at <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/Deepak5310.6748013/">XDA Developers</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and contribute to the open-source community. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
